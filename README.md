## Background and Goals for Our Project
We were inspired to focus our hack on the rise of instagram accounts exposing sexual assault stories from college campuses across the US, including the Case Western account @cwru.survivors; and the history of sexual assault on campuses nationwide. We wanted to create an iOS app that would help sexual assault survivors and students navigate the dangerous reality of college campuses. With our app, it will be easier for a survivor report instances of harassment, while maintaining the integrity of the user data, and ensuring that data is anonymous and randomized. Our app will map safe and dangerous areas on campus based on user data to help women, minorities, and sexual assault survivors feel protected.

### "When I looked in the mirror the next day, I could hardly recognize myself. Physically, emotionally, and mentally." -A submission on @cwru.survivors IG page

Even with the #MeToo movement, there's only so much that technology can do. However, we hope that by creating this app, we will help college students take accountability and create a campus culture that can best foster learning and contribute towards social good.

### "The friendly guy who helps you move and assists senior citizens in the pool is the same guy who assaulted me. One person can be capable of both. Society often fails to wrap its head around the fact that these truths often coexist, they are not mutually exclusive." - Chanel Miller

## User/sociologist questions
- To take this further within the research sphere, there would be Privacy/IRB considerations, according to Rachel Lovell, an sociologist who specializes in sexual assault. Currently, the app maps dangerous areas without specifying an address, to avoid privacy concerns about locations of assaults.
- With the anonymous platform, there is the possibility of false information. How accurate is the data?
- Why would students need this?
- What makes a student report and what discourages them from reporting?
- How we can try to address that?

## Next steps
- Integrating hardware with Adafruit Bluefruit device

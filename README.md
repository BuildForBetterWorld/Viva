## Background and Goals for Our Project
With the rise of sexual assault stories emerging at the instagram accound @cwru.survivors, and on campuses nationwide, we wanted to create an iOS app that would help survivors and students navigate the reality of college campuses. It will be easier for a survivor report instances of harassment, maintain the integrity of the data, and ensure that data is anonymous and randomized.

### "When I looked in the mirror the next day, I could hardly recognize myself. Physically, emotionally, and mentally." -A submission on @cwru.survivors IG page

With the #MeToo movement, there's only so much that technology can do. We hope that by creating this app, it's time that college students take accountability and create a campus culture that can best foster learning and contribute towards social good.

### "The friendly guy who helps you move and assists senior citizens in the pool is the same guy who assaulted me. One person can be capable of both. Society often fails to wrap its head around the fact that these truths often coexist, they are not mutually exclusive." - Chanel Miller

## User/sociologist questions
- To take this further within the research sphere, there would be Privacy/IRB considerations, according to Rachel Lovell, an sociologist who specializes in sexual assault.
- Other concerns? How accurate is this information?
- Why would students need this?
- What makes a student report and what discourages them from reporting?
- How we can try to address that?

## Next steps
- Integrating hardware with Adafruit Bluefruit device

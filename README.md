## Background and Goals for Our Project
With the rise of sexual assault stories emerging at the instagram accound @cwru.survivors, and on campuses nationwide, we wanted to create an iOS app that would help survivors and students navigate the reality of college campuses. It will be easier for a survivor report instances of harassment, maintain the integrity of the data, and ensure that data is anonymous and randomized.
